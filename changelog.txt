v0.1.4
------
- Fixes:
 - Fixed decals rendering onto disabled B9PS part variants
   - Decals will still not update whan their parent part's B9PS variant is changed, both in flight and in the editor. This is known and awaiting a change to B9PS to be fixed.
 - Fixed decal bounds rendering as dark cubes when shadowed by EVE clouds.
 - Fixed decals being shadowed by EVE clouds, causing the part underneath to appear overly dark.

v0.1.3
------
Fixes:
- Fixed decals being able to be scaled down to 0

Changes:
- Made decal bounds no longer collide in flight, this is done by repurposing layer 31 (which is configurable in the ConformalDecals.cfg file)
- Decals will now be unselectable in flight by default. This can be disabled with the `selectableInFlight` value in ConformalDecals.cfg, or in the module config itself.
- Decal parts will now destroy themselves automatically when the parent part is destroyed
- Small refactor of node parsing code
  - Colors can now be specified in hex (#RGB, #RGBA, #RRGGBB, or #RRGGBBAA) or using the colors specified in the XKCDColors class

v0.1.2
------
Fixes:
- Disabled writing to the zbuffer in the decal bounds shader. Should fix any issues with Scatterer or EVE.

v0.1.1
------
Fixes:
- Fixed flag decal not adjusting to new texture sizes immediately.
- Fixed decal bounds being visible on launch.
- Fixed decal bounds being visible in the part icon.
