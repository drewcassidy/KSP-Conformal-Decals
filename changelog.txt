v0.2.3
------
- Fixes:
 - Fixed TMP subobjects being deleted, causing fallback fonts to fail in some situations.
 - Started using URL-style encoding for text decals behind the scenes to prevent issues with certain characters.
 - Fixed text decals having zero size when they had only whitespace or an empty string.
 - Fixed decals having drag and causing issues when using FAR.
 - Fixed broken saving of text decals in certain circumstances.
 
v0.2.2
------
- Fixes:
 - Fixed corrupted text rendering when a vessel loads during a scene change.

v0.2.1
------
- Changes:
 - Pressing enter in the text entry window now types a newline.
- Fixes:
 - Renamed font assetbundle. The old extension was causing the game to try to load it twice on Windows due to legacy compatability features.
 - Fixed text rendering on DirectX resulting in black boxes by using ARGB32 instead of RG16 for the render texture in DirectX.

v0.2.0
------
- New Parts:
 - CDL-3 Surface Base Decal: A set of conformal decals based on the symbols from the movie Moon (2009) designed by Gavin Rothery
 - CDL-T Custom Text Decal: A customizable text decal with a variety of fonts
- Changes:
 - New ModuleConformalText module for customizable text
  - Text, font, and style can all be customized, as well as text fill and outline colors and widths
  - Same projection and opacity options as other conformal decals
  - New StandardText decal shader supporting the text module
 - Unified all decal shaders into a single "StandardDecal" shader with variants supporting any combination of bump, specular and emissive maps, plus SDF alphas.
  - Old shaders are remapped to Standard shader plus keywords automatically.
  - New SDF-based antialiasing for when decals extend to their borders, e.g. on opaque flags.
 - New "KEYWORD" material modifier, allowing for shader features to be enabled and disabled.
 - Material modifiers can now be removed in variants by setting `remove = true` inside them.
- Fixes:
 - Fixed WIDTH and HEIGHT scale modes being flipped
 - Removed some debug log statements
- Dependencies:
 - Updated ModuleManager to version 4.1.4

v0.1.4
------
- Supported KSP versions: 1.8.x to 1.10.x
- Fixes:
 - Fixed decals rendering onto disabled B9PS part variants
   - Decals will still not update whan their parent part's B9PS variant is changed, both in flight and in the editor. This is known and awaiting a change to B9PS to be fixed.
 - Fixed decal bounds rendering as dark cubes when shadowed by EVE clouds.
 - Fixed decals being shadowed by EVE clouds, causing the part underneath to appear overly dark.

v0.1.3
------
Fixes:
- Fixed decals being able to be scaled down to 0

Changes:
- Made decal bounds no longer collide in flight, this is done by repurposing layer 31 (which is configurable in the ConformalDecals.cfg file)
- Decals will now be unselectable in flight by default. This can be disabled with the `selectableInFlight` value in ConformalDecals.cfg, or in the module config itself.
- Decal parts will now destroy themselves automatically when the parent part is destroyed
- Small refactor of node parsing code
  - Colors can now be specified in hex (#RGB, #RGBA, #RRGGBB, or #RRGGBBAA) or using the colors specified in the XKCDColors class

v0.1.2
------
Fixes:
- Disabled writing to the zbuffer in the decal bounds shader. Should fix any issues with Scatterer or EVE.

v0.1.1
------
Fixes:
- Fixed flag decal not adjusting to new texture sizes immediately.
- Fixed decal bounds being visible on launch.
- Fixed decal bounds being visible in the part icon.

v0.1.0
------
Initial release!

New parts:
- CDL-F Flag Decal: Conformal flag decal, which uses either the mission flag or a flag of your choosing.
- CDL-1 Generic Decal: A set of conformal generic decals for planes and rockets
- CDL-2 Semiotic Standard Decal: A set of conformal decals based on the Semiotic Standard for All Commercial Trans-Stellar Utility Lifter and Transport Spacecraft designed by Ron Cobb for the movie Alien
